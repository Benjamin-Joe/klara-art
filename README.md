# Website


# Overview
This is my project for portfolio project 5 with code institute. I decided to make an art e-commerce store as my wife is a talented artist, and I wanted to create something that I can actually utilise and help her create her own business. Creating an e-commerce site was both fun and challenging. It has helped me to understand more about the inner workings of django. A language of which I am very fond of. Using bootstrap has also given me a much needed refresher on html and css.
Having all of the bootstrap information and code gave me the ability to focus on more on the functionality of the website.

# Wireframes
<br>
I used wireframes to map out the basic structure of the website. It allowed me to have a visual plan,
so that I would not stray of course. The creation of the wireframes also helped me to have a preview
as to what works well and what doesn't work very well. Bellow are images of the wireframes I created 
for this project.
