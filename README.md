# Wireframes
<br>
I used wireframes to map out the basic structure of the website. It allowed me to have a visual plan,
so that I would not stray of course. The creation of the wireframes also helped me to have a preview
as to what works well and what doesn't work very well. Bellow are images of the wireframes I created 
for this project.
